Victor Porton has given superfluous feedback about features also has 
about 17 commits whose relevance was of some minimal importance. 

Victor Porto has helped me financially during 8 months to keep this project on.
The relevance of the financial help was important to achieve arcamens
as it is now although the reasons behind his financial help weren't
of the best nature.
