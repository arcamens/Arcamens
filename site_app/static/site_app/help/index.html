<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>Arcamens was designed to allow a high level of communication and collaboration by teams. It implements so called Kanban Boards and Timelines. Timelines can be used to delegate isolated tasks, share information, events, questions and even store information that is pertinent to a project.</p>
<p>The aim of arcamens is being as flexible as possible. It allows better dealing with high payloads of information and facilitates better organization of information. Arcamens is ideal for all kind of teams whose motto is simplicity and flexibility.</p>
<p>The boards, lists and cards are structured in a tree-like manner what allows a succinct perspective of the information that is relevant to the board team.</p>
<p>The following image displays an example set of boards:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/arcamens-boards-0.png" alt="arcamens-boards-0" /><figcaption>arcamens-boards-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After accessing the board, its lists are shown.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/arcamens-boards-1.png" alt="arcamens-boards-1" /><figcaption>arcamens-boards-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once a list is accessed by clicking on its link name it displays all the cards that it holds.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/arcamens-boards-2.png" alt="arcamens-boards-2" /><figcaption>arcamens-boards-2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Arcamens boards allow one to deal with a high amount of cards in a very advantageous manner because information is more visible. It allows one to pin certain lists that are often used thus allowing quick access of content.</p>
<p>Pinning an element is as easy as clicking on the clip icon as shown below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/arcamens-boards-3.png" alt="arcamens-boards-3" /><figcaption>arcamens-boards-3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can pin boards, lists, cards or timelines.</p>
<p>Arcamens makes usage of cut/copy for moving cards around, it is much more efficient than the usual drag&amp;drop approach. You can cut several cards, these will stay on the clipboard when you’re ready just paste them somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="board-creation">Board Creation</h3>
<p>You can create as many boards as you desire. For creating a new board just click on Home at the navbar and then use the popup menu by clicking the wrench icon shown at this image:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/board-creation-0.png" alt="board-creation-0" /><figcaption>board-creation-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/board-creation-1.png" alt="board-creation-1" /><figcaption>board-creation-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One may find it necessary to have boards that are related to the same project, in such situations it is possible to set their descriptions with a slug to group them according to their project.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a project named arcamens that has many plugins, you have a team for each one of the plugins. You could come up with boards description like:</p>
<pre><code>Arcamens/Github
Arcamens/Bitbucket</code></pre>
<p>Then you can use your board filter with a pattern like:</p>
<pre><code>Arcamens/</code></pre>
<p>It would display just boards that meet that slug.</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="#collection-filter">Collection Filter</a></p>
<h3 id="list-creation">List Creation</h3>
<p>Lists are placed inside boards, After accessing the board link name you can create new lists for the board.</p>
<p>For such click on +List link button.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/list-creation-0.png" alt="list-creation-0" /><figcaption>list-creation-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/list-creation-1.png" alt="list-creation-1" /><figcaption>list-creation-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can set slugs for lists as well, you could handle a project with many plugins using the approach of setting slugs for each one of your project plugins as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Bitbucket/Todo
Github/Todo
Bitbucket/Doing
Github/Doing

...</code></pre>
<p>It allows designing your project workflow without creating multiple boards for its plugins.</p>
<h3 id="card-creation">Card Creation</h3>
<p>Card are the entities which contain actual information pieces.</p>
<p>Cards are created inside lists, after accessing a list just click on +Card:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-creation-0.png" alt="card-creation-0" /><figcaption>card-creation-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-creation-1.png" alt="card-creation-1" /><figcaption>card-creation-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The card label field is used to give a short description of the task, the data field can contain markdown content and should be used when the content is too long. After filling the fields and creating your task, you would get the view of the card:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-creation-2.png" alt="card-creation-2" /><figcaption>card-creation-2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Click on Up to get back to the card list.</p>
<p>You can change all attributes for the card there, whenever an attribute is changed then an event is fired. All users who are related to the card will get notified. These users are those who belong to the card board or are assigned to the card.</p>
<h3 id="card-edition">Card Edition</h3>
<h3 id="events">Events</h3>
<p>Whenever an user creates or updates content then an event is fired. The events are means of knowing what is going on with your teams.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/events-0.png" alt="events-9" /><figcaption>events-9</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The action that was performed can be commented on thus giving constructive criticism about your peers work.</p>
<p>Events will carry links to the objects that are related to the user action. You can left click on the links and inspect the cards, lists, etc in the same browser tab or just middle click and open them in new browser tabs.</p>
<p>When you finished checking an user action you can mark the event as seen then it will be no longer listed in the Events dialog but you can still access it through your logs.</p>
<h3 id="card-workers">Card Workers</h3>
<p>After a card is created it can be assigned to someone for its execution by clicking on Workers:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-workers-0.png" alt="card-workers-0" /><figcaption>card-workers-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-workers-1.png" alt="card-workers-1" /><figcaption>card-workers-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Type a string that matches either the user name or email then hit enter. So you will be able to add users to the card task.</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="#advanced-user-search">Advanced User Search</a></p>
<h3 id="board-permissions">Board Permissions</h3>
<p>A board will have a owner (the one who has created it), admins and members. The owner is the only one who can make a member become an admin. Admins are allowed to add/remove members to the board but members aren’t allowed to remove peers.</p>
<p>For adding new members to the board (assuming you’re the owner or an admin), just access the board then click on the wrench icon:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/board-permissions-0.png" alt="board-permissions-0" /><figcaption>board-permissions-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then click on Members, you would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/board-permissions-1.png" alt="board-permissions-1" /><figcaption>board-permissions-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can search users by using tag, email or name attributes, then add users.</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="#advanced-user-search">Advanced User Search</a></p>
<p>After binding/unbinding a given user to a board he/she will get notified of it.</p>
<h3 id="tag-creation">Tag Creation</h3>
<p>You can tag all kind of content in arcamens, for such you need to create tags first. Everyone is allowed to create new tags, when a tag is created an event is fired and everyone in the organization gets aware of it.</p>
<p>Click on the wrench icon on the organization menu:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/tag-creation-0.png" alt="tag-creation-0" /><figcaption>tag-creation-0</figcaption>
</figure>

</figure>
<p>You would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/tag-creation-2.png" alt="tag-creation-2" /><figcaption>tag-creation-2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that if your organization has many tags then you can look up a given tag by its name or description. Just insert the pattern and hit enter then you’ll get all tags that match the criterea.</p>
<p>Clicking on the plus sign it gives you:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/tag-creation-3.png" alt="tag-creation-3" /><figcaption>tag-creation-3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fill the tag name and description and then click on Create.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/tag-creation-4.png" alt="tag-creation-4" /><figcaption>tag-creation-4</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="card-tags">Card Tags</h3>
<p>Tags are a powerful mean of classifying content, arcamens allows you to tag cards, posts and users. For tagging a given card just access the card by clicking on its label link.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-tags-0.png" alt="card-tags-0" /><figcaption>card-tags-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then you’ll view the card attributes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-tags-1.png" alt="card-tags-1" /><figcaption>card-tags-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Click on Tags button at the card toolbar:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-tags-2.png" alt="card-tags-2" /><figcaption>card-tags-2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then you’ll be able to manage the card tags:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-tags-3.png" alt="card-tags-3" /><figcaption>card-tags-3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you add/remove a tag to a card then everyone who is related to the card will get notified. You can look up the card tags by typing some pattern that shows on the tag name/description then hit enter. It is useful when your organization has many tags.</p>
<h3 id="card-prioritization">Card Prioritization</h3>
<p>Arcamens implements card prioritization in a very smart and elegant manner. You can easily prioritize a card over other cards by specifying a consistent set of critereas.</p>
<p>When a card priority changes then your board peers get notified and the order of the cards get changed. It is very handy when you want to make sure that a given task has more urgency than others.</p>
<p>The way of how order of cards is changed in arcamens it differs in concept from the often used drag&amp;drop from trello-like platforms.</p>
<p>You are prompted with a list of cards that you want to increase/decrease priority from. You can easily filter cards based on a criterea in that list it spares a lot of time when you want to prioritize a card over some other cards that are classified under a given set of tags.</p>
<p>The order of cards is defined by prioritization which is set as described below</p>
<p>Just click on the signal icon:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-prioritization-0.png" alt="card-prioritization-0" /><figcaption>card-prioritization-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then you would get a list of cards that are in the list:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-prioritization-1.png" alt="card-prioritization-1" /><figcaption>card-prioritization-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In that dialog you can use the same usual syntax for card search. Notice that if you have many cards in the list and you want to make sure that the card has priority superior to a given set of cards that contain a tag then you could do:</p>
<pre><code>tag:sometag</code></pre>
<p>It would list all cards with that tag thus you can easily change card priority over other cards.</p>
<h3 id="card-search">Card Search</h3>
<p>In order to perform global card search just click on: Cards at the navbar.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-search-0.png" alt="card-search-0" /><figcaption>card-search-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-search-1.png" alt="card-search-1" /><figcaption>card-search-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>with the above search/filter pattern it finds all cards that contain the strings ‘render’ and ‘template’ either in the label or data attribute. The data attribute of a card it is the one that carries markdown.</p>
<p>If you defined as search pattern:</p>
<pre><code>python django + render template + form</code></pre>
<p>It would list all cards that contain the strings ‘python django’, ‘render template’ ad ‘form’ either in the label or data attribute.</p>
<p>Notice that if you wanted the search pattern to be matched against archived cards instead, then it would be necessary to mark the field Done as checked.</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="#advanced-card-search">Advanced Card Search</a></p>
<h3 id="search-for-card-tasks">Search for Card Tasks</h3>
<p>In arcamens there is a generic concept of task, a card becomes a task when it is assigned to someone. When the task is accomplished then one can just archive it. The card will remain available for later inspection.</p>
<p>In order to search for active or archived cards that contain bound workers to, just click on the Tasks/Cards at the navbar:</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The mechanism will match the search pattern against all cards that can be accessed by you.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/search-for-card-tasks-0.png" alt="search-for-card-tasks-0" /><figcaption>search-for-card-tasks-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From the dialog window you can search through all cards that have at least one user bound to.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/search-for-card-tasks-1.png" alt="search-for-card-tasks-1" /><figcaption>search-for-card-tasks-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Assigned to me</strong></p>
<p>When this option is checked then the filter pattern will be matched against all cards that were assigned to you.</p>
<p><strong>Created by Me</strong></p>
<p>When this option is checked then the filter pattern will match all cards that were assigned to someone and the owner is you.</p>
<p><strong>Done</strong></p>
<p>This option allows to search for archived cards instead of active ones.</p>
<p>In the above example it finds all cards that are assigned to you and contain the strings ‘bug’ and ‘timezone’ either in the label or data attributes.</p>
<p>You can get more than one match depending on the pattern and the existing cards. Once you have filtered the cards then you can click on the card link and open it in the actual browser tab or just right click and open in a new tab.</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="#advanced-card-search">Advanced Card Search</a></p>
<h3 id="organization-creation">Organization Creation</h3>
<p>Organizations can serve on multiple purposes depending on the kind of business and size. You can map a team to an organization, a business branch to an organization or even handle all your business team in a single organization.</p>
<p>It all depends on how big your business is and on your necessities of designing your business workflow.</p>

<p>You would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/timeline-creation-1.png" alt="timeline-creation-1" /><figcaption>timeline-creation-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that you can associate timelines to a given project by setting up a common slug. You could fill the above fields with:</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Notes</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Arcamens/</p>
<p>Or you could do:</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Arcamens/Notes</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Notes on arcamens project.</p>
<p>There are many ways of grouping boards and timelines, feel free to pick up the best one for you. You don’t need to pick a description for your boards/timelines at all.</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> Collection Filters</p>
<p>After filling the fields you would get your timeline being listed altogether with your boards.</p>
<h3 id="posts">Posts</h3>
<p>Timeline posts can be used for multiple purposes, they can convey information about events, tasks and even play a nice role as project notes. Snippets can be attached to posts, a snippet can contain a title and markdown content.</p>
<p>Tasks that demand one to collect information regarding a given subject can be delegated by using posts. The person attaches the missing information to the post as a snippet.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-0.png" alt="post-0" /><figcaption>post-0</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When a post has workers who were assigned it may be interesting to call attention of these workers through e-mail. A link for the post would be sent through e-mail with a message.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-email-notification-0.png" alt="post-email-notification-0" /><figcaption>post-email-notification-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can click on the worker name and then:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-email-notification-1.png" alt="post-email-notification-1" /><figcaption>post-email-notification-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After clicking on Request attention through e-mail you would be prompted with:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-email-notification-2.png" alt="post-email-notification-2" /><figcaption>post-email-notification-2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fill the form and send the e-mail notification.</p>
<p>You can as well send notification to all post workers by clicking on Alert Workers.</p>
<h3 id="post-prioritization">Post Prioritization</h3>
<p>Arcamens timelines can play the role of backlogs where it can be used with scrum methodology, timelines can also be used for isolated task delegation.</p>
<p>Prioritization of posts work alike the one for cards, when a given post is prioritized then an event is generated and everyone who is in the post’s timeline gets notified.</p>
<p>For doing prioritization of a given post just access the timeline then click on the signal icon at the post:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-prioritization-0.png" alt="post-prioritization-0" /><figcaption>post-prioritization-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then would get a list of posts that are in that timeline:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-prioritization-1.png" alt="post-prioritization-1" /><figcaption>post-prioritization-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Imagine that you had a long product backlog with 200 posts that are correctly classified with tags. What if you wanted to just prioritize a given post that corresponds to a bug fix over all other posts that correspond to features? Well, you can just use the post filter pattern language to select all posts that contain the tag bug:</p>
<pre><code>tag:bug</code></pre>
<p>That is just a simple case you could have a lot of many other possibilities.</p>
<p>Using this approach for prioritization of posts/cards rather than the usual drag/drop thing it allow to improve work quality and productivity because correct ordering of priorities can be done more accurately.</p>
<p>You can change the post priority up/down some other card to make it explicit to your timeline peers the correct order of tasks execution. You should also notice that prioritizing posts change the displaying order of the posts.</p>
<h3 id="post-search">Post Search</h3>
<p>The post search mechanism allow to search through all posts that you have access regardless if it has a worker or not. For such just click on the Post link at the navbar:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-search-0.png" alt="post-search-0" /><figcaption>post-search-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then you would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-search-1.png" alt="post-search-1" /><figcaption>post-search-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>Would find all posts where the three strings show up either in the label or markdown:</p>
<pre><code>bug + engine + wheels</code></pre>
<p>Would find all posts where the strings ‘bug’ or ‘engine wheels’ show up.</p>
<pre><code>bug + engine wheels</code></pre>
<p>Leave the <strong>Done</strong> field checked to search only through archived posts.</p>
<h3 id="search-for-post-tasks">Search for Post Tasks</h3>
<p>When a post is created and it is assigned to someone then it becomes a task. It is possible to search for archived or active tasks by clicking at the Tasks/Posts link at the navbar:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/search-for-post-tasks-0.png" alt="search-for-post-tasks-0" /><figcaption>search-for-post-tasks-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then you would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/search-for-post-tasks-1.png" alt="search-for-post-tasks-1" /><figcaption>search-for-post-tasks-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The option <strong>Assigned to me</strong> would perform the search pattern through all tasks that someone has assigned to you even if it was assigned by yourself.</p>
<p>If you option for <strong>Created by me</strong> then it would check the pattern against all posts that you created and it was at least one worker binded to.</p>
<p>In the above example it matches all cards that you are assigned to and contains the strings ‘snippet’, ‘form’, ‘html’.</p>
<p>Notice that the order of strings is not relevant; You could also try:</p>
<pre><code>need a snippet + form + html</code></pre>
<p>Which would work alike.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Leave the Done attribute checked for searching only through the archived posts.</p>
<h3 id="event-comments">Event Comments</h3>
<p>All kind of user actions in Arcamens are liable of being commented. Whenever an user assigns a worker to a post it generates an event then the event/action can be commented out.</p>
<p>When an user action is commented then another event is generated but it doesn’t allow comments for action comments.</p>
<p>Click on Events at the navbar:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/event-comments-0.png" alt="event-comments-0" /><figcaption>event-comments-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then you would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/event-comments-1.png" alt="event-comments-1" /><figcaption>event-comments-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By clicking on the event Comments link:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/event-comments-2.png" alt="event-comments-2" /><figcaption>event-comments-2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The users who are related to the event would get a new event like:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/event-comments-3.png" alt="event-comments-3" /><figcaption>event-comments-3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>They can reply by clicking on the event Comments link.</p>
<h3 id="post-filter">Post Filter</h3>
<p>It is possible to filter timeline posts as well, whenever you access the timeline then it will list just posts that match the filter pattern.</p>
<p>For such just access the timeline then click on Filter at the timeline menu:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-filter-0.png" alt="post-filter-0" /><figcaption>post-filter-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-filter-1.png" alt="post-filter-1" /><figcaption>post-filter-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is mostly useful for filtering posts based on tag, owner or workers but it works with simple patterns as well.</p>
<p>Would list all posts that have both tags.</p>
<pre><code>tag:feature + tag:bug</code></pre>
<p>Would list all posts whose owner’s email or name matches the string ‘last.src’:</p>
<pre><code>owner:last.src</code></pre>
<p>Listing posts that has a specific worker:</p>
<pre><code>worker:last.src</code></pre>
<p>Would list all posts that have two workers whose name/email matches both strings.</p>
<pre><code>worker:last.src + worker:porton</code></pre>
<p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="#advanced-post-search">Advanced Post Search</a></p>
<h3 id="collection-filter">Collection Filter</h3>
<p>Timelines and boards can be grouped by subject/project, it allows to form collections of boards/timelines. One could have a project that has many plugins and keep a board for each one of its plugins.</p>
<p>It is necessary to stabilish a naming convention for your boards/timelines.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>Timeline: Arcamens/Notes

Board: Arcamens

Timeline: Arcamens/News

Timeline: Arcamens/Bugs</code></pre>
<p>All these objects have a common pattern in its name. As arcamens allows to setup filter for boards/timelines then if you want to view just boards or timelines that are related to a given subject it gets simple.</p>
<p>Just click Home at the navbar and click on the Filter link at the organization menu:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/collection-filter-0.png" alt="collection-filter-0" /><figcaption>collection-filter-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/collection-filter-1.png" alt="collection-filter-1" /><figcaption>collection-filter-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the previously stated context if you typed the string ‘Arcamens’ then you would view all the boards/timelines that contain such a string either in its name or description.</p>
<h3 id="card-colors">Card Colors</h3>
<p>When a card is a task it displays as green:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-colors-0.png" alt="card-colors-0" /><figcaption>card-colors-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When a card is assigned to you then it displays as red:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-colors-1.png" alt="card-colors-1" /><figcaption>card-colors-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A card fork’s background is lighter than the usual card as well:</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="card-e-mailnotifications">Card E-mail/Notifications</h3>
<p>When a card is created and it has workers bound then it is possible to send e-mail notifications to the card workers.</p>
<p>For such just access the card then click on the card worker name:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-email-notification-0.png" alt="card-email-notification-0" /><figcaption>card-email-notification-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You’ll get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-email-notification-1.png" alt="card-email-notification-1" /><figcaption>card-email-notification-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After clicking on <strong>Request Attention through e-mail</strong> you would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-email-notification-2.png" alt="card-email-notification-2" /><figcaption>card-email-notification-2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can fill with some message to be sent to the user.</p>
<p>When the card has many workers you can just click on the <strong>Alert workers?</strong> link then sending an alert to all card workers at once.</p>
<h3 id="card-filter">Card Filter</h3>
<p>You can specify a pattern for filtering cards inside lists as well thus allowing one to view just cards that have attributes matching requirements.</p>
<p>Access the desired list then click on Filter at the list menu:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-filter-0.png" alt="card-filter-0" /><figcaption>card-filter-0</figcaption>

<p>You would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-filter-1.png" alt="card-filter-1" /><figcaption>card-filter-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can filter by tag, worker, owner etc.</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="#advanced-card-search">Advanced Card Search</a></p>
<h3 id="card-relations">Card Relations</h3>
<h3 id="card-forks">Card Forks</h3>
<p>When a given task can’t be executed at once then it is necessary to break it into multiple subtasks. In Arcamens it is named card forking, when you fork a card you create a link between both cards.</p>
<p>Consider the card below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-forks-0.png" alt="card-forks-0" /><figcaption>card-forks-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In order to fork such a card just click on : Fork/Card link then you would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-forks-1.png" alt="card-forks-1" /><figcaption>card-forks-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When there are many lists you can just filter the lists based on a pattern:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-forks-2.png" alt="card-forks-2" /><figcaption>card-forks-2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you wanted to search for a list named “beta” that is in a board named “alpha” then you could do:</p>
<pre><code>alpha + beta</code></pre>
<p>Notice that if you inserted just the list name it would output more results if you have other lists named like this. It is also important to notice that the above pattern would match all lists that either board name or list name contains each one of the strings “alpha” and “beta”.</p>
<p>For more consistent results just use:</p>
<pre><code>board:alpha + name:beta</code></pre>
<p>It would make sure to list just a list from a board that contains the string “alpha” in its name and the list name contains the string “beta”.</p>
<p>Once you pick up the desired list you will get the fork creation dialog:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-forks-3.png" alt="card-forks-3" /><figcaption>card-forks-3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you click on <strong>Keep old content</strong> link it will fill the fields with the parent card attributes. It is useful sometimes when you just want to fork and edit the previous task.</p>
<p>After forking you’ll get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/card-forks-4.png" alt="card-forks-4" /><figcaption>card-forks-4</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can browse all forks and parents of a given card by following the links on the card.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can open a given card in a new browser tab by just right clicking it then open in a new tab.</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="#advanced-list-search">Advanced List Search</a></p>
<h3 id="post-forks">Post Forks</h3>
<p>Timeline posts can be forked into cards, it is mostly useful when a timeline is used as a kanban board backlog.</p>
<p>Timelines are great for sharing information of all kind, one might use a timeline to get bug reports and fork the bug reports into card tasks over their corresponding project boards. It all depends on how you feel more comfortable to model your team workflow.</p>
<p>For forking a post just access the post:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-forks-0.png" alt="post-forks-0" /><figcaption>post-forks-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After that just click on: Fork/Card it would give you:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-forks-1.png" alt="post-forks-1" /><figcaption>post-forks-1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For basic understanding on how to filter lists:</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="#card-forks">Card Forks</a></p>
<p>After picking up the desired list you would get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/post-forks-2.png" alt="post-forks-2" /><figcaption>post-forks-2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After creating the card then everyone who is attached to the timeline and to the destin list’s board will get notified of the fork creation.</p>
<p>Some features that should be implemented may be related to multiple project boards, the forking mechanism allows a fancy approach for keeping track of all tasks that are necessary in order to have a given feature implemented.</p>
<p>For a more complete reference on list filters:</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="#advanced-list-search">Advanced List Search</a></p>
<h3 id="advanced-user-search">Advanced User Search</h3>
<p>You can search users for attributes like name, e-mail or tags.</p>
<pre><code>tag:developer</code></pre>
<p>Would list all organization users who were tagged with developer. You can combine tags as well.</p>
<pre><code>tag:developer + tag:python </code></pre>
<p>You can combine tags but mix them with other kind of attributes like name or email.</p>
<pre><code>tag:dev + @arcamens.com</code></pre>
<p>Would list all workers that were tagged as developer and the email matches <span class="citation" data-cites="arcamens.com">@arcamens.com</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/static/site_app/help/advanced-user-search-0.png" alt="advanced-user-search-0" /><figcaption>advanced-user-search-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that if you did:</p>
<pre><code>tag:dev + oliveira</code></pre>
<p>It would list all users with the tag dev and have the string oliveira appearing either in the name or email attributes. When you want to limit the search to be performed under a given attribute like email you could do:</p>
<pre><code>tag:dev + email:oliveira</code></pre>
<h3 id="advanced-card-search">Advanced Card Search</h3>
<h3 id="advanced-post-search">Advanced Post Search</h3>
<h3 id="advanced-list-search">Advanced List Search</h3>
<p>When forking cards/posts it is necessary to search the desired board list that will contain the fork. Lists are searched pretty much like cards/posts except that it contains some different attributes.</p>
<p>List attributes used in searches:</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong></p>
<p>The one who has created the list.</p>
<p><strong>name</strong></p>
<p>The name of the list.</p>
<p><strong>board</strong></p>
<p>The board that contains the list.</p>
<p><strong>description</strong></p>
<p>The list description.</p>
<p>When no attribute is specified then the default attributes that are assumed consist of the board name and list name.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>arcamens + todo</code></pre>
<p>The above pattern would match all lists that contains each one of the strings either in the board name or list name. So, if there were a list named Todo in a board named Arcamens then it would be listed.</p>
<p>Suppose you wanted to list all lists whose owner is a guy named iury and it is named Todo:</p>
<pre><code>owner:iury + name:todo</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the owner attribute is used then it matches against the owner name and e-mail.</p>
<p>If you wanted to search all lists based on description then you could do:</p>
<pre><code>description:contain bugs</code></pre>
<p>It would list all lists that contains the string ‘contain bugs’ in its description. When searching by using the description attribute it is mostly useful if you have a project with many plugins and you’re handling all your plugins insde the project board.</p>
<p>The naming scheme examplifies the situation:</p>
<pre><code>Arcamens
    Name:Todo
    Description:core_app
    .
    .
    .

    Name:Todo
    Description:bitbucket_app

    Doing
    Description:bitbucket_app

    Done
    Description:bitbucket_app

    To check
    Description:bitbucket_app


    .
    .
    .</code></pre>
<p>Imagine you wanted to fork a given card from core_app/Todo list into bitbucket_app/Todo list:</p>
<pre><code>arcamens + description:bitbucket</code></pre>
<p>That would be enough to list all lists from board arcamens whose description contains the slug string ‘bitbucket’.</p>
<p>You could as well do:</p>
<pre><code>board:arcamens + description:bitbucket</code></pre>
<p>Which would give you more accurate results in case you have other boards where the string ‘arcamens’ shows in.</p>
