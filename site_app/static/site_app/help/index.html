<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Arcamens was designed to allow a high level of communication and collaboration by teams.
It implements so called Kanban Boards and Timelines.
Timelines can be used to delegate isolated tasks, share information, events, questions and even store information that is
pertinent to a project.</p>
<p>The aim of arcamens is being as flexible as possible. It allows better dealing with high payloads of information and facilitates
better organization of information. Arcamens is ideal for all kind of teams whose motto is simplicity and flexibility.</p>
<p>The boards, lists and cards are structured in a tree-like manner what allows a succinct perspective
of the information that is relevant to the board team.</p>
<p>The following image displays an example set of boards:</p>
<p><img alt="arcamens-boards-0" src="/static/site_app/help/arcamens-boards-0.png" /></p>
<p>After accessing the board, its lists are shown.</p>
<p><img alt="arcamens-boards-1" src="/static/site_app/help/arcamens-boards-1.png" /></p>
<p>Once a list is accessed by clicking on its link name it displays all the cards
that it holds.</p>
<p><img alt="arcamens-boards-2" src="/static/site_app/help/arcamens-boards-2.png" /></p>
<p>Arcamens boards allow one to deal with a high amount of cards in a very advantageous manner
because information is more visible. It allows one to pin certain lists that are often used
thus allowing quick access of content.</p>
<p>Pinning an element is as easy as clicking on the clip icon as shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="arcamens-boards-3" src="/static/site_app/help/arcamens-boards-3.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can pin boards, lists, cards or timelines.</p>
<p>Arcamens makes usage of cut/copy for moving cards around, it is much more efficient than
the usual drag&amp;drop approach.  You can cut several cards, these will stay on the clipboard
when you're ready just paste them somewhere.</p>
<h3>Board Creation</h3>
<p>You can create as many boards as you desire. For creating a new board just click on Home at the navbar
and then use the popup menu by clicking the wrench icon shown at this image:</p>
<p><img alt="board-creation-0" src="/static/site_app/help/board-creation-0.png" /></p>
<p>You would get:</p>
<p><img alt="board-creation-1" src="/static/site_app/help/board-creation-1.png" /></p>
<p>One may find it necessary to have boards that are related to the same project, in such situations
it is possible to set their descriptions with a slug to group them according to their project.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a project named arcamens that has many plugins, you have a team for each one of the plugins.
You could come up with boards description like:</p>
<pre><code>Arcamens/Github
Arcamens/Bitbucket
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can use your board filter with a pattern like:</p>
<pre><code>Arcamens/
</code></pre>
<p>It would display just boards that meet that slug.</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> Link to board filters.</p>
<h3>List Creation</h3>
<p>Lists are placed inside boards, After accessing the board link name you can
create new lists for the board.</p>
<p>For such click on +List link button.</p>
<p><img alt="list-creation-0" src="/static/site_app/help/list-creation-0.png" /></p>
<p>You would get:</p>
<p><img alt="list-creation-1" src="/static/site_app/help/list-creation-1.png" /></p>
<p>You can set slugs for lists as well, you could handle a project with many plugins
using the approach of setting slugs for each one of your project plugins as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Bitbucket/Todo
Github/Todo
Bitbucket/Doing
Github/Doing

...
</code></pre>
<p>It allows designing your project workflow without creating multiple
boards for its plugins.</p>
<h3>Card Creation</h3>
<p>Card are the entities which contain actual information pieces.</p>
<p>Cards are created inside lists, after accessing a list just click on +Card:</p>
<p><img alt="card-creation-0" src="/static/site_app/help/card-creation-0.png" /></p>
<p>You would get:</p>
<p><img alt="card-creation-1" src="/static/site_app/help/card-creation-1.png" /></p>
<p>The card label field is used to give a short description of the task, the data field
can contain markdown content and should be used when the content is too long.
After filling the fields and creating your task, you would get the view of the card:</p>
<p><img alt="card-creation-2" src="/static/site_app/help/card-creation-2.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Click on Up to get back to the card list.</p>
<p>You can change all attributes for the card there, whenever an attribute is changed
then an event is fired. All users who are related to the card will get notified.
These users are those who belong to the card board or are assigned to the card.</p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>Whenever an user creates or updates content then an event is fired. The events
are means of knowing what is going on with your teams.</p>
<p><img alt="events-9" src="/static/site_app/help/events-0.png" /></p>
<p>The kind of action that was performed can be commented out thus giving constructive criticism about your peers
work.</p>
<p>Events will carry links to the objects that are related to the user action. You can left click on the links
and inspect the cards, lists, etc in the same browser tab or just middle click and open them in new browser
tabs.</p>
<p>When you finished checking an user action you can mark the event as seen then it will be no longer listed in the
Events dialog but you can still access it through your logs.</p>
<h3>Card Workers</h3>
<p>After a card is created it can be assigned to someone for its execution by clicking on Workers:</p>
<p><img alt="card-workers-0" src="/static/site_app/help/card-workers-0.png" /></p>

<p><img alt="card-workers-1" src="/static/site_app/help/card-workers-1.png" /></p>
<p>Type a string that matches either the user name or email then hit enter.</p>

<h3>Board Permissions</h3>
<p>A board will have a owner(the one who has created it), admins and members. The owner
is the only one who can make a member become an admin. Admins are allowed to add/remove members to the board
but members aren't allowed to remove peers.</p>

<h3>Timelines</h3>
<p>Timelines are great for sharing information, storing notes regarding a project and even delegating simple tasks.
Timelines can be used as super backlogs when deaing with Scrum Methodology. As posts can be forked into cards
it allows one to setup a timeline to be used as a scrum board backlog.</p>
<h3>Timeline Creation</h3>
<p>For creating a timeline just click on Home at the navbar then on the wrench icon at the organization
toolbar:</p>
<p><img alt="timeline-creation-0" src="/static/site_app/help/timeline-creation-0.png" /></p>
<p>You would get:</p>
<p><img alt="timeline-creation-1" src="/static/site_app/help/timeline-creation-1.png" /></p>
<p>Notice that you can associate timelines to a given project by setting up a common slug.
You could fill the above fields with:</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Notes</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Arcamens/</p>
<p>Or you could do:</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Arcamens/Notes</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Notes on arcamens project.</p>
<p>There are many ways of grouping boards and timelines, feel free to pick up the
best one for you. You don't need to pick a description for your boards/timelines at all.</p>
<p><strong>See:</strong> Collection Filters</p>
<p>After filling the fields you would get your timeline being listed altogether with your boards.</p>
<h3>Posts</h3>

tasks and even play a nice role as project notes. Snippets can be attached to posts, a snippet
can contain a title and markdown content. </p>
<p>Tasks that demand one to collect information regarding a given subject can be delegated by using posts. 
The person attaches the missing information to the post as a snippet.</p>
<p><img alt="post-0" src="/static/site_app/help/post-0.png" /></p>
<p>Some tasks arent directly related to a specific project these tasks
can be delegated to a team or user by using a post.</p>
