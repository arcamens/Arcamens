## Intro

Arcamens implements so called Kanban Boards and Timelines, the latter can be used for multiple purposes. 
They can be used to delegate isolated tasks, share information, events, questions and even store information that is
pertinent to a project.


The aim of arcamens is being as flexible
as possible. It allows better dealing with high payloads of information and better organization of 
information. Arcamens is ideal for all kind of teams whose motto is simplicity and flexibility.

The boards, lists and cards are structured in a tree-like manner it allows a succinct perspective
of the information that is relevant to the board team.

Once a list is accessed by clicking on its link name it displays all the cards
that it holds.

Arcamens boards allow one to deal with a high amount of cards in a very advantageous manner
because information is more visible. It allows one to pin certain lists that are often used
thus allowing quick access of content.

Pinning an element is as easy as clicking on the clip icon as shown below:

**Note:** You can pin boards, lists, cards or timelines.

Arcamens makes usage of cut/copy for moving cards around, it is much more efficient than
the usual drag&drop approach.  You can cut several cards, these will stay on the clipboard
when you're ready just paste them somewhere.

### Board Creation

You can create as many boards as necessary, it is even possible to add a short description
that can be used to group a given set of boards that are related to a specific project.

For creating a new board just click on Home at the navbar then

![board-creation-0](/static/site_app/help/board-creation-0.png)

You would get:

![board-creation-1](/static/site_app/help/board-creation-1.png)

One may find it necessary to have boards that are related to the same pproject, in such situations
it is possble to set your boards description with a slug to group them according to their project.

Imagine you have a project named arcamens that has many plugins, you have a team for each one of the plugins.
You could come up with boards description like:



    Arcamens/Github
    Arcamens/Bitbucket
    

Then you setup your board filter with a pattern like:


    Arcamens/
    

It would display just boards that meet that slug.

**See:** Link to board filters.

### List Creation

Lists are placed inside boards, After accessing the board link name you can
create new lists for the board.

For suck click on +List link button.

![list-creation-0](/static/site_app/help/list-creation-0.png)

You would get:

![list-creation-1](/static/site_app/help/list-creation-1.png)

You can set slugs for lists as well, you could handle a project with many plugins
using the approach of setting slugs for each one of your project plugins as follows:


    Bitbucket/Todo
    Github/Todo
    Bitbucket/Doing
    Github/Doing
    
    ...
    

It allows designing your project workflow without creating multiple
boards for its plugins.

### Card Creation

Cards are created inside lists, after accessing a list just click on +Card:

![card-creation-0](/static/site_app/help/card-creation-0.png)

You would get:

![card-creation-1](/static/site_app/help/card-creation-1.png)

The card label field is used to give a short description of the task, the data field
can contain markdown content and should be used when the content is too long.
After filling the fields and creating your task, you would get the view of the card:
